    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>My name is Vanderley Santos, I am a student at the Namibia University of Science and Technology and am currently a third-year student studying computer science. I enjoy learning about software and am especially fascinated with web development and building web applications. I consider myself to be quite hardworking and goal-orientated meaning that once I set my sights on something I will achieve it. I am fluent in both English and Portuguese, with Portuguese being my native language, and I am also a conversational speaker of Afrikaans. I am an active choir member at the Central Methodist Church of Namibia. In my spare time, I enjoy playing basketball and reading books. I enjoy learning about new cultures and traditions where I live, and the existing ones around the world. I look forward to providing quality services in my area of specialty once I finish with my studies and I am eager to continue learning and helping my community with my craft.</p>
